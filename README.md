# Case Study: Trajectory Data Analysis, Part I

## General Information

This Case Study is about creating algorithms that carry out numerous analyses of trajectory data. Beyond designing algorithms, we will implement and analyze them in order to complete three tasks. Each of which entails modeling a problem and running experiments on the implemented algorithm to analyze the solution.

## Installation
Below is what should be installed to do the three tasks:
```
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```
## Technologies
* The datasets provided (geolife-cars.csv, geolife-cars-ten-percent.csv, geolife-cars-thirty-percent.csv, geolife-cars-sixty-percent.csv)
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.9.12
* matplotlib.pyplot

#### fd(P,Q) and assignment E<sub>max</sub>
The file contains code to compute the algorithm E<sub>max</sub> as well as fd(P,Q) that realize the minimum values. It also includes the trajectory pairs (128-20080503104400, 128-20080509135846),(010-20081016113953, 010-20080923124453), and (115-20080520225850, 115-20080615225707) which can be run on the algorithm. So for each pair the histograms of lengths of edges can be plotted. In order to create the histograms matplotlib.pyplot will be needed.
