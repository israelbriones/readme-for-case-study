# Case Study: Trajectory Data Analysis, Part I

## General Information

This Case Study is about creating algorithms that carry out numerous analyses of trajectory data. Beyond designing algorithms, we will implement and analyze them in order to complete three tasks. Each of which entails modeling a problem and running experiments on the implemented algorithm to analyze the solution.
