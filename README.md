# Case Study: Trajectory Data Analysis, Part I

## General Information

This Case Study is about creating algorithms that carry out numerous analyses of trajectory data. Beyond designing algorithms, we will implement and analyze them in order to complete three tasks. Each of which entails modeling a problem and running experiments on the implemented algorithm to analyze the solution.

## Installation
Below is what should be installed to do the three tasks:
```
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```
## Technologies
* The datasets provided (geolife-cars.csv, geolife-cars-ten-percent.csv, geolife-cars-thirty-percent.csv, geolife-cars-sixty-percent.csv)
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.9.12
* matplotlib.pyplot

## Task 1
In this task,

## Task 2
In this task,


## Task 3
In this task, we want to design algorithms that compute dtw(P,Q) and fd(P,Q) along with assignments E<sub>avg</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> that realize the minimum values. In our code we are able to do the following:

*  Implement the algorithms to compute dtw(P,Q) and fd(P,Q)
* Run both algorithms for trajectory pairs (128-20080503104400, 128-20080509135846),(010-20081016113953, 010-20080923124453), and (115-20080520225850, 115-20080615225707). We use that to plot a histogram for each pair for both E<sub>avg</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> and their lengths of edges.
* Compute a simplification of each of T1 = 115-20080520225850, T2 = 115-20080615225707 for ε = 0.03,0.1,0.3 (kilometers).

#### fd(P,Q) and assignment E<sub>max</sub>
The file contains code to compute the algorithm E<sub>max</sub> as well as fd(P,Q) that realize the minimum values. It also includes the trajectory pairs (128-20080503104400, 128-20080509135846),(010-20081016113953, 010-20080923124453), and (115-20080520225850, 115-20080615225707) which can be run on the algorithm. So for each pair the histograms of lengths of edges can be plotted. In order to create the histograms matplotlib.pyplot will be needed.
